####Measuring Ocean Health Indexes for Chile

###Data Management Planning Tool

Types of data
Existing data was collected from institutions and government agencies of Chile through web searching and direct contact with institutions and scientists.

Data types will be layers (numeric, text and data frames) and spatial (shapefiles)

Data and metadata standards
Metadata include value, filename.csv, value units, score value range, extraction (local, global, scientific literature, raster, website)

Policies for access and sharing
all data, program code and results are freely available via the service GitHub https://github.com/OHI-Science/ and http://ohi-science.org/chl

Policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution
Plans for archiving and preservation of access
Data will be available at

https://github.com/OHI-Science/ and http://ohi-science.org/chl

## Data Question
How many species in conservation status there are in XI region of Chile?

```{r}
if (basename(getwd()) == 'env-info'){
  setwd('students')
}
# present working directory
getwd()

# list files
list.files()

# load libraries
library(readr)
library(dplyr)




# read in csv
species_XI = read_csv("C:/Users/Patricia/Desktop/Environmental Informatics/env-info/students/data/faundez_species_Chile.csv") 

head(species_XI)
summary(species_XI)

# limit columns to species, region and conservation status
species_XI_2 = species_XI[,c('species', 'XI', 'conservation_status')]

# limit rows to just species "1"
species_XI_3 = species_XI_2[species_XI_2$XI  == '1',]

# write to csv
write.csv(species_XI_3, 'C:/Users/Patricia/Desktop/Environmental Informatics/env-info/students/data/faundez_XI.csv', row.names = FALSE)


```


I have questions with the use of dplyr

# dplyr elegance
species_XI %T>%                          # note tee operator %T>% for glimpse
  glimpse() %>%                       # view data
  select(species, XI, conservation_status) %>%        # limit columns
  filter(XI  == '1') %>%     # limit rows
  
  write_csv('C:/Users/Patricia/Desktop/Environmental Informatics/env-info/students/data/faundez_2XI.csv') # write out csv
